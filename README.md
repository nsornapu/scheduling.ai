Running the Application Locally with SAM CLI

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the scheduling-ai application locally using the AWS SAM CLI.

Prerequisites:
Install AWS SAM CLI: Follow the installation guide for your operating system at AWS SAM CLI Installation.
Install Docker: Docker is required to run the application locally. Follow the installation guide for your operating system at Docker Installation.


Steps:

1.
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nsornapu/scheduling.ai.git
cd scheduling-ai

2.
Build the Docker image:
sam build

3.
Start the local API:
sam local start-api

The SAM CLI will start a local API at http://127.0.0.1:3000. You can test the /hello endpoint by accessing http://127.0.0.1:3000/hello in your web browser or using tools like curl or Postman.

Note:
The sam build command will install the required dependencies and build the application.
The sam local start-api command will start the local API and automatically redeploy the application whenever changes are detected in the source code.

Additional Information:
To view the logs generated by the application, use the following command:
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name scheduling-ai --tail
To stop the local API, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the sam local start-api command is running.
